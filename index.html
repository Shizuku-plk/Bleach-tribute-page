              I am so happy it came in. There was no issue with the shipping process. 
              The box and manga inside are in perfect condition. There were no scratches 
              on the cover nor any dents in the box. I was pleasantly surprised it came 
              wrapped in plastic as well. The manga inside are all counted for all volumes are white

              As soon as this arrived, I was immediately struck by how awesome the box is that all 
              the books came in. The cardboard is sturdy and covered in beautiful full-color artwork 
              and even has a nice plastic handle at the top for easy transport. All of the manga inside 
              was in perfect condition, in order, and not missing any pages/books/whatever.
